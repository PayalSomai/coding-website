  <p align="center"><b></b>Jenny Zhang, 33, was born in Shanghai and raised in New York. She is a graduate of Stanford University and the Iowa Writers’ Workshop for fiction. She has two published collections of poetry, Hags and Dear Jenny, We Are All Find, for which Zhang was compared to “a 21st-century Whitman, only female, Chinese, and profoundly scatological” and her other work, Sour Heart, which is a collection of short stories about New York’s Chinese American community largely told from the point of view of young girls. Her love for writing stemmed from her quite and shy personality as a child and turned her form of escape into her passion. Since publishing her two works, she's been working on a novel and hopes to publish it soon.  </p>

  <p align="center"><b></b>Mexican artist Frida Kahlo is remembered for her self-portraits, pain and passion, and bold, vibrant colors. She is celebrated in Mexico for her attention to Mexican and indigenous culture and by feminists for her depiction of the female experience and form. Kahlo, who suffered from polio as a child, nearly died in a bus accident as a teenager. During her slow recovery, Kahlo spent her time focused on her art by teaching herself how to paint and eventually creating her world renowned self-portraits. Her work has travelled from Mexico to the Untited States of America and even exhibted in The Louvre, Paris. Kahlo continued painting until her death in 1954 where her artworks continued to be showcased around the world.</p> <!-- insert paragraph, the 'b' is for bold, to change to italics = <i>, underlined = <u> -->

  <p align="center"><b></b>While not widely known in her own time, Jane Austen's comic novels of love among the landed gentry gained popularity after 1869, and her reputation skyrocketed in the 20th century. Her novels, including Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, are considered literary classics, bridging the gap between romance and realism. Ever fascinated by the world of stories, Austen began to write in bound notebooks as a teenager and in the 1790s, during her adolescence, she started to craft her own novels. Now in her 30s, Austen started to anonymously publish her works. In the period spanning 1811-16, she pseudonymously published Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park and Emma. On days Austen wasn't socialising with friends or playing piano, she spent her time reading novels (including her own) aloud to her family. She died on July 18, 1817, suspected of Allison's disease. Austen left behind a legacy that allowed for adaptations of her work and gaining the hearts of millions around
     the world. </p>
