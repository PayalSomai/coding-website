  <p align="center"><b>Wonder Women: 25 Innovators, Inventors, and Trailblazers Who Changed History</b></p>
   <p align="center"><b>By Sam Maggs</b></p>
   <p align="center"><b></b>You may think you know women’s history pretty well. But have you ever heard of. . .

·  Alice Ball, the chemist who developed an effective treatment for leprosy—only to have the credit taken by a man?
·  Mary Sherman Morgan, the rocket scientist whose liquid fuel compounds blasted the first U.S. satellite into orbit?
·  Huang Daopo, the inventor whose weaving technology revolutionized textile production in China—centuries before the cotton gin?

Smart women have always been able to achieve amazing things, even when the odds were stacked against them. In Wonder Women, author Sam Maggs tells the stories of the brilliant, brainy, and totally rad women in history who broke barriers as scientists, engineers, mathematicians, adventurers, and inventors. Plus, interviews with real-life women in STEM careers, an extensive bibliography, and a guide to women-centric science and technology organizations—all to show the many ways the geeky girls of today can help to build the future.</p>

  <p align="center"><b>Feminists Don't Wear Pink (and Other Lies): Amazing Women on what the F-word Means to Them</b></p>
   <p align="center"><b>Book by Scarlett Curtis
</b></p>
  <p align="center"><b></b>A collection of writings from extraordinary women, from Hollywood actresses to teenage activists, each telling the story of their personal relationship with feminism, this book explores what it means to be a woman from every point of view. Often funny, sometimes surprising, and always inspiring, this book aims to bridge the gap between the feminist hashtag and the scholarly text by giving women the space to explain how they actually feel about feminism. </p>  <br>

  <p align="center"><b>FEMINIST COMEBACKS</b></p>
   <p align="center"><b>Book by Scarlett Curtis
</b></p>
  <p align="center"><b></b>“I have read enough books and academic essays on feminism to fill a fairly substantial library, and yet as soon as I’m asked to sum it up I start sweating and string together a few unintelligible sentences before loudly shouting and running to get another drink. To save you from this embarrassing fate I have put together a collection of the feminist comebacks that I wish I’d thought of in the moment. Rip out this page, keep it in your back pocket and whip it out next time you’re at a party or stuck in line for the loo with a drunk man at a party.” </p>  <br>

  <p align="center"><b>Hood Feminism</b></p>
   <p align="center"><b>By Mikki Kendall
</b></p>
  <p align="center"><b></b>In her searing collection of essays, Mikki Kendall takes aim at the legitimacy of the modern feminist movement, arguing that it has chronically failed to address the needs of all but a few women. Drawing on her own experiences with hunger, violence, and hypersexualization, along with incisive commentary on politics, pop culture, the stigma of mental health, and more, delivers an irrefutable indictment of a movement in flux. An unforgettable debut, Kendall has written a ferocious clarion call to all would-be feminists to live out the true mandate of the movement in thought and in deed.
