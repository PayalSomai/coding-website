  <p align="center"><b></b>Ruchi Sanghvi is an Indian computer engineer and businesswoman. Sanghvi pursued a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in electrical computer engineering from Carnegie Mellon University and was the first female engineer hired by Facebook. In 2011, she started her own company, Cove, with two other co-founders and in 2012, Cove was sold to Dropbox where Sanghvi joined as the VP of operations. The next year, she left Dropbox. In 2016, the computer engineer set up South Park Commons, a residential and professional tech space functioning similar to a hackerspace.

  <p align="center"><b></b>A theoretical physicist, Dr. Jackson has had a distinguished career that includes senior leadership positions in academia, government, industry, and research. She holds an S.B. in Physics, and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Elementary Particle Physics — both from MIT. She is the first African American woman to receive a doctorate from MIT — in any field — and has been a trailblazer throughout her career, including as the first African-American woman to lead a top-ranked research university. She is the recipient of 53 honorary doctorate degrees and she received the National Medal of Science in 2015 by President Obama. She is one among the 50 most important women in Science by Discover Magazine. Her inventions have paved the way for numerous developments in the telecommunication space, including the portable fax, the touch-tone telephone, caller ID, fiber-optic cable and call waiting. </p>  <br>

  <p align="center"><b></b>Stephanie Diana Wilson is an American engineer and a NASA astronaut. She flew to space onboard three Space Shuttle missions, and is the second African American woman to go into space, after Mae Jemison. As of 2021, her 42 days in space are the most of any female African American astronaut. Born in 1966, Wilson graduated from Harvard in 1988 and, after many years of studying and training, was selected as an astronaut by NASA in April 1996. Her research as an engineer contributed to all three Space Shuttle missons she flew and is an inspiration to all young girls of colour. </p>
