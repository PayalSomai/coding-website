  <p><b></b>What a great question! Unfortunately, the answer isn’t as straightforward. Like I explained before, the definition of feminism is different for everyone. How I define feminism wouldn’t be the same as how you or your neighbour would define feminism. But, for the sake of my website, we’re going to define feminism like so: creating equality amongst people regardless of their race, gender, sex, age, identity, welath or socio-economic status. </p> <!-- insert paragraph, the 'b' is for bold, to change to italics = <i>, underlined = <u> -->
  <br>

  <p><b></b>Now, my personal journey to becoming a feminist wasn’t liner and even now, the road is always changing. Not because I’m constantly wondering if it’s worth becoming a feminist (it totally is), but rather because I’m still learning about what it means to be part of the feminist movement.   </p> <!-- insert paragraph, the 'b' is for bold, to change to italics = <i>, underlined = <u> -->
  <br>

  <p><b></b>Feminism originated as a western ideology but that doesn’t mean the concept of feminism didn’t exist worldwide. Evident in South Africa’s 1956 march to the Union Buildings in Pretoria, feminism isn’t new and will be around until equality gets treated as a right and not as a privilege. But, even from knowing about the roots of feminism, many misconceptions of feminism plague the internet. So I’m here to clear the air and hopefully gain a fellow feminist in the process! </p> <!-- insert paragraph, the 'b' is for bold, to change to italics = <i>, underlined = <u> -->
  <br>

  <p><b></b>Number 1: If you’re a feminist, you hate men. </p> <!-- insert paragraph, the 'b' is for bold, to change to italics = <i>, underlined = <u> -->
  <br>

  <p><b></b>Nope. Not true. The goal of feminism is to create equality amongst everyone, regardless of if they’re a man, woman or somewhere on the gender spectrum. Hating men and bringing them down completely defeats the purpose of creating equality. Feminists who advocate for women’s rights are unfortunately sometimes seen as only advocating for themselves. It’s incredibly frustrating as feminists fight for equal pay, better representation and more opportunities among women, that men are bestowed upon without a second thought. Feminism is creating a bridge to close the chasm between men and women, not make it bigger. Besides, I know enough feminists who love men! </p> <!-- insert paragraph, the 'b' is for bold, to change to italics = <i>, underlined = <u> -->
<br>

<p><b></b>Number 2: If you’re a feminist, you can’t be ‘girly’. </p>
<br>

<p><b></b>Once again, no. Being ‘girly’, or rather ‘feminine’, doesn’t make you less of a feminist. People don’t wear make-up because they’re insecure. They wear it because it’s a form of art! A way to express yourself! And wearing clothes that make you comfortable doesn’t mean you don’t care about your looks. Rock those baggy hoodies!! Live in your sweatpants!! And if your comfort clothes are skirts and crop tops then wear them!! You don’t have to justify your appearance to anyone in order to prove you’re a ‘real’ feminist.
 </p>
<br>

<p><b></b>Number 3: Feminists can only be women. </p>
<br>

<p><b></b>WRONG. Feminism is open to everyone, regardless of your gender!! Supporting equality shouldn’t be a job exclusively for women since to create this change, we need all the help we can get! Unfortunately, most people who aren’t women feel excluded from the feminist community, and it’s our job to show them that it’s okay to be a part of us.  </p>
<br>
<p><b></b>There are many more misconceptions to correct but these are the most popular. As you can tell, feminism means no harm and isn’t something to be scared of. But that doesn’t mean it’s perfect. Like I mentioned before, intersectional feminism is something that’s been around forever but hardly anything is done to accommodate it.</p>
<br>

<p><b></b>A good example would be the misrepresentation and harmful stereotypes of WOC in the media. Most TV shows and movies don’t have a diverse production team filled with WOC and this leads to having a drastic lack of WOC on the big screen. And, on the off chance you do find WOC in movies/TV shows, they’re portrayed as harmful stereotypes that don’t properly represent WOC. And, if we were to take the other factors of intersectional feminism into account, such as gender, sexual orientation, wealth or disabilities, you’d find how much lack of representation there is. And this is where we come in!! </p>
<br>

<p><b></b>As the next generation, it’s important for us to advocate for the equality of everyone. We have to find ways to change the system to make it possible for people to get paid the same salaries regardless of their gender, race or disability. We have to offer that helping hand and stand with one another in the fight for equality otherwise we’re going to stay in this never ending cycle of inequality. </p>
